I'm currently listening to all of my Deep Purple music right now (not just the Christmas stuff) while writing up the new website for some clients of mine and a API. I mentioned about Deep Purple because they are coming tomorrow at [Casa Arena in Horsens Denmark](http://maps.google.com/maps?cid=12968903021654238929) and I'm GOING :D . Yeah I enjoy the life in Horsens. I finally had the chance to meet [Mud Morganfield](http://www.mudmorganfieldsite.com/) and talk with him and I got a signed vinyl album of [The Goo Men](http://www.thegoomen.no/) and all of this was only possible because of the good friends from [KulisseLageret](http://www.kulisselageret.dk/) so all I wanna say is a big THANK YOU guys.

And some pictures just to show off :)
