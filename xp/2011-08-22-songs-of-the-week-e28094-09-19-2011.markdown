Actually, I haven’t listened to all that much new music of late, and that — combined with my busy days — are the cause of the missing posts. But I’m through with all that… for last week anyway. :)

    Galaxies — Owl City
    Stars — Switchfoot
    Can’t Shut Up — Anthem Lights
    Terminals — Relient K
    Hello Hurricane — Switchfoot
