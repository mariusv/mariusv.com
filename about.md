Hey there. My name is Marius Voila curently I live in London, United Kingdom. I'm a
<a href="anime.html">Anime</a> lover and since 4 years a go I started to really enjoy <a href="http://pictures.mariusv.com">photography</a> and bicycling. If you wanna send my a gift and don't know what you can have a peak at my <a href="/wish.html">wishlist</a> and get inspired (I prefer original present ideas but if you don't wanna risk you can use the list :-) ). </p>

I'm a Linux sysadmin with over [14 years of experience](/experience.html), and doing [DevOps](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps) before I even knew DevOps was a thing. I'm specialising in deployments, cloud computing, load balancing, scaling and performance tuning, as well as developing disaster-recovery best practices such as backups and restorations, firewalls, and server security audits.

## About This Site ##

This is my personal blog, giving me a place to talk about my interests, blow off
steam, and have some fun. 

The color scheme for the site is based on the popular [Zenburn][] colors which
I prefer for my coding environments.  It's easy to look at for long periods of
time, and works surprisingly well for a blog.
