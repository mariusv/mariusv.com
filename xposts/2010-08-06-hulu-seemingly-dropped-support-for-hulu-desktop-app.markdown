**UPDATE:** It works again, but only most of the time. And they've added Hulu Plus content!

I'm not really sure why all the tech blogs aren't talking about this, but the
[Hulu Desktop app](http://www.hulu.com/labs/hulu-desktop), which apparently is not being actively
developed anymore, [stopped working](http://www.hulu.com/discussions/19/148508/696074) sometime
Wednesday (Aug 4) evening for seemingly everyone. This has really upset a lot of people as it is
currently, arguably the best way to watch Hulu videos on an
[HTPC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_theater_PC). Some people are claiming that Hulu has dropped
support for the app, and since then, they've added things like [Hulu Plus](http://www.hulu.com/plus)
(that doesn't work on the app either) and changed the way their streaming works which broke
compatibility with the app. I, myself, was very exited when the Hulu Desktop app came out (currently
using a Mac Mini hooked up to my HDTV) and I use it **a lot**. I am very sad to see it go.
