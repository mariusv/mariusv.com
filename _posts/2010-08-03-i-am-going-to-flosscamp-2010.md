  I can't miss [FLOSSCamp](http://camp.softwareliber.ro), it has become a tradition and everybody will be there. It will happen at Poiana Secuilor, near Predeal.
   If you don't know what is a FLOSSCamp for us, here is a description: an offline meeting for FLOSS contributors from all Romania, no matter their project affiliation, where we spend a week-end in the middle of the nature, with talks, distro-wars, camp fire, beer, grilled food, fun time and so on (a flamewar is so much better face to have with a beer in hand...).
