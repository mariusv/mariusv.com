Please try this:

1. Go to [Twitter.com](http://twitter.com) from a fresh browser, ie, not logged in.

2. Sign up for a new account, name it anything you like.

3. Without following anyone, sit and view your stream for a little while. An hour or two should do.

4. Return in a month, view your stream. Does it still look like it did a month ago?

5. Write an article on how no one uses Twitter, it's a ghost town and a complete failure.

Let me know how that works out for you.
