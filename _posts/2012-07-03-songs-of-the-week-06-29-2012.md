I haven’t listened to all that much new music of late, and that - combined with my busy days - are the cause of the missing posts and sadly the missing posts part will continue because I have a lot of things to do..but the music part I'll change it starting from now :-)

So ladies and gents I give you the Songs of the last week :-)
