Every year I can't miss [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2014/), it has become a tradition for me and like last year the trip is sponsored by [Rackspace UK](http://www.rackspace.co.uk) which I want to thank with this occasion for their generosity. If you don't know what [FOSDEM](https://fosdem.org/2014/) is then you must have been living under a rock for the past 13 years so here is a Wikipedia link which will help with a fair description and the history of [FOSDEM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOSDEM) .
If any of you will be there and want to have a beer/talk you can find me on Saturday in the room **H.1309** for the [Configuration management](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/configuration_management/) talks. Will be there the whole day as for me this is one of the most interesting talks. Sunday will be in room **UA2.114** for [NoSQL](https://fosdem.org/2014/schedule/track/nosql/) talks
