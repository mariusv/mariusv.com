I'm walking back to my place from the [Deep Purple](http://www.deeppurple.com/) concert and I'm a bit disappointed because of the [Ian Gillan's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ian_Gillan) voice, I mean I know he is old and all but what the heck when you see you can't keep up with your own band then quit. The biggest surprise for me was when I entered in the concert hall and I saw the hall full with chairs...I understand the fact that danish people are lazy but c'mon Deep Purple are known as the loudest band in the history and for god sake is a [ROCK CONCERT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music) you don't go to listen the band who practicaly invented modern hard rock music and show by sitting silently on the chairs like children's in the school. Was a one and a half hour concert and in all this time I had to stay on my chair(that made me go crazy but when in Rome, do as the Romans do) at one point my butt felt asleep so I hope that this long walk will wake it up :))

But long story short the band was awesome and the guitar and drums solos was amazing...and the [Neue Philharmonie Frankfurt](http://www.last.fm/music/Neue+Philharmonie+Frankfurt) was more then I expected. Overall the concert was EPIC even with those minor glitches and I have to say [takket v√¶re en masse](http://translate.google.com/#da|en|takket%20v%C3%A6re%20en%20masse) to Jeppe Vind from [KulisseLageret](http://www.kulisselageret.dk/) for giving me tickets and for having the chance of listening Deep Purple Live for the first time in my life and I hope not the last time :D .

After reading this article I hope no danish person will feel offended or something but you know is the truth..I mean for god sake again: is a [ROCK CONCERT](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_music) not a opera concert...you do it wrong :)
