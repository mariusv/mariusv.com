Sometimes there is a very quick need to determine what user(s) are causing high load to a particular page. Instead of tailing high-speed logs and giving yourself a headache, Throw in a one-lined piped cat command to give you the info youâ€™re after without the foreplay.
`cat /path/to/access.log | awk '{print $1}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail`
