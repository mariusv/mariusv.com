It may be hard to imagine in today's world, but there was once a time when computers didn't exist, cell phones didn't exist. If you go back far enough, there was even a time the written word didn't exist.

We should feel privileged to live in an era of such advancements. It's easier than ever to stay connected with people and develop relationships all over the world.

But this era of [Facebook](https://facebook.com/marius.voila), [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mariusvoila), [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/u/0/114522783618340495104) (each not even a decade old) can be dangerous too. Stepping back to a simpler world now and then can prove beneficial. It's also extremely difficult.

**Breaking An Addiction**

Cell phones have been [likened to cigarettes](http://articles.moneycentral.msn.com/Investing/SuperModels/CellPhonesAreTheNewCigarettes.aspx), and [one study](http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/07/28/ep.smartphone.obsessed.cohen/index.html) found that the average person checks their phone 34 times a day. Internet usage itself is increasingly [becoming an addiction](http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/25/technology-is-the-new-smoking/).

It's especially tough to step away from all of these gadgets and opportunities for connectivity when you work in the online business like I do. Industries today have been transformed by 24/7 Twitter feeds, touched by the ubiquity of Facebook and impacted by new tools like Google+. If you don't keep up, you'll be left behind by the intense competition out there.

The addiction is very real for me. Many told me I could never do it. I decided to try this anyway: One week without posting anything on Facebook, Twitter or Google+.

**A Good Feeling**

Seven days after I began my challenge, I'm proud to say I succeeded: not a single update to Twitter, Facebook or Google+. Therefore, it is possible to step away, survive and even thrive. It's not necessarily lazy either -- it's opening up your eyes to brand new experiences (reading, observing and immersing myself in the culture and history of [Horsens](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horsens), the people around me and nature, I learned dozens of new things every day).

So, as painful as it was at first, it was refreshing, relaxing and I truly do feel recharged. The proof is there in my streams, and no one can take it away from me: nothing posted on my Twitter, Facebook and Google+ pages between Oct. 24 and Oct. 31(and I'm thinking to take even a longer "vacation" from Facebook).

Maybe that duration scares the daylights out of you, but I highly recommend you try this too. Even for just a weekend. You'll thank me later. [Hej](http://translate.google.ro/#da|en|Hej)! And [tak](http://translate.google.ro/#da|en|tak) for reading.
