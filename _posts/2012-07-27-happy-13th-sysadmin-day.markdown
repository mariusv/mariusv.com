In case you weren’t pay­ing atten­tion in the last few weeks, today is the [13th annual Sys­tem Admin­is­tra­tor Appre­ci­a­tion Day](http://sysadminday.com/). It’s always the last Fri­day in July. A good reminder to not make changes on Fri­days so you can stay out drink­ing with your colleagues. So happy SYSADMIN DAY to all of us :-D
