[![](http://www.mariusv.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/google-plus-360.jpg)](https://plus.google.com)Ladies and gentlemen [Google+](https://plus.google.com) is here, or somewhere here, in the [presentations](http://www.google.com/intl/en-US/+/learnmore/index.html), on [YouTube](http://youtu.be/xwnJ5Bl4kLI), but not in front of me.
After today’s loud announcement all over the net I ended at Google+. Or Google Wave? I’m not sure because everything’s the same. It’s like a Déjà vu to me.
When Wave was launched it was presented like something that would revolutionize the way people communicate. After such an uproar and the longest presentation video I had ever watched, trying to test this service ended on the initial wave page, where beside the video was info that the service was in the test phase and access was given to only a limited number of users. When I finally got access I had nothing to try, my contacts weren’t there. Today I logged in with my Google account on this new service just to find similar message. You get the point here. I wonder how my social life on Google+ would look like? Probably all alone and waiting for my friends to come to the party, one on every 3 hours. I’m sure my friends will come and go. I see that the Google guys somewhat realized the point of social life creating these “circles” (which is not something new, Facebook has this). Realized that not everyone is like them and not everyone wants to index the entire world. However, if you’re interested to get yourself on the invitation waiting list this is the [place](https://services.google.com/fb/forms/googleplusenuk/).
The search giant’s new social project will be omnipresent on its products, thanks to a complete redesign of the navigation bar. The familiar gray strip at the top of every Google page will turn black, and come with several new options for accessing your Google+ profile, viewing notifications and instantly sharing content. The notification system is similar to how Facebook handles notifications, complete with a red number that increases with each additional notice.
