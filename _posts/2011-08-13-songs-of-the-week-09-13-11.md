Hmm… I really don’t have anything cool to say about my collection of favorite songs this week. I guess they’re  just what I listened to and enjoyed. Hope you do too!

The Redeemer — Sanctus Real
In Christ Alone — Owl City
Umbrella Beach — Owl City
Those Nights — Skillet
Small Rebellions — Jars of Clay
