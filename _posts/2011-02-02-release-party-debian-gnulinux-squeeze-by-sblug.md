As the new version of [Debian GNU/Linux](http://debian.org) is about to be launched in 5 days, the [Linux User Group in Sibiu](http://www.sblug.ro) is preparing a traditional release party for the well known distribution at Haller Cafe on 5th February 7 PM local time.
The event will be divided in 3 parts: contributions to the [Debian GNU/Linux project](http://debian.org), beer & comments on Squeeze and possible some bowling in the end.

More details [here](http://www.sblug.ro/debian-squeeze-release-party) or subscribe to [SbLUG mailing list](http://liste.sblug.ro/cgi-bin/mailman/listinfo)(only in Romanian).
So we will be waiting you in [Haller Cafe in „Pia?a Mare”](http://osm.org/go/0gMMofB6U-)
