Few days ago somebody asked me why do I use Debian and why do I think is the best distribution out there. After explaining for around 30 minutes I decided to put my thoughts about this in here just in case somebody is wandering why to choose [Debian GNU](http://www.debian.org/) and not other derived from [Debian](http://www.debian.org/) distributions.

* Easy upgrades

* Inclusion of more than 29.000 integrated software packages

* Rock-solid stability, there is no need to reboot for standard updates or upgrades

* Superior system security

* Proven reliability in real world situations by thousands of demanding commercial, industrial, academic and non-profit organizations around the globe

* The most carefully thought out policy of any computing platform

* Provides significant consistency among packages

* Requires separation of configuration, code, and data

* Packaging modularity requirements allow for a smaller footprint

* Consistent help interface: Man pages are required, info(1) is optional

* Institutionalizes the value of working to support 100% of users without disadvantaging any type of user

* Default configurations should work for most users without configuration

* Much, much more!

* Relatively straightforward configuration and upgradeability

* Source code availability to help us find bugs, fix security flaws without waiting for patches, and customize features to better meet your business objectives

* Support by a community that includes over 1,200 registered developers

* The most cosmopolitan Linux distribution with large installed bases in every region on SpaceShip Earth making it uniquely positioned to benefit from the growing trends of globalization

* Supported by a guiding vision in its Social Contract and Software Guidelines that will ensure a dedicated army of people from all around the globe to keep Debian improving on a sustainable basis

* Democratic governance structure that helps ensure success moving forward

* The best bug tracking system of any Linux distribution to rout out bugs and misfeatures

* Like the Linux kernel, Debian developed as the spontaneously collaborative initiative of hundreds and eventually thousands of individuals. Phenomena that spontaneously organize have a primacy in their constitution that is rare, special, long-lived and fundamentally re-orienting for society and markets (as Woodrow Wilson observed, "the highest and best form of efficiency is the spontaneous cooperation of a free people")

* The synergetic effect of these advantages is that our Debian-focused development is less expensive and more robust than if we based our software on other Linux distributionsï»¿

* Is the only distro that can run on many CPU architectures, you have the option to have not only the Linux kernel but NetBSD, FreeBSD and Hurd kernels as well
